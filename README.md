# Image to SceneGraph XML Conversion
This is a command line utility to convert image files to the SceneGraph XML files used in COMP-175 at Tufts University. A project in the class requies students to write an XML file creating an interesting scene; this utility generates such files. It can generate XML from most common image formats, including jpg, png, and gif, and supports various arguments for orienting the resulting scenes and for extruding pixels based on brightness values to give an illusion of depth.
